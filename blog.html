<p id="indent"> I'm one of the most indecisive people you'll ever meet. I started a webpage about a conspiracy theory, and then changed it mid working beause I didn't think many people would take interest or understand it. Then I started to work on my educational development plan but stopped because I don't even know exactly what I want to do with my life. Then I started this 'personal blog'. I'm hoping it ends in something looking like tumblr. Some may say I'm indecisive because of my zodiac sign and being a libra the scale may never be even. Who knows I may even change this idea. I am a detroit native, but I'll always have a home in hamtramck, since that is where most of me memories. I currently go to Ferris State University (go bulldogs) where I'm studying CIS. I originally wanted to study psychology, but my family shot that idea down being that it doesn't bring money to the table and requires too much schooling. Inspired by my cousin, who is a computer engineer they pushed me to study CIS. That's what made me take up this internship at journi, and turns out I really love it. Coding isn't bad, I actually enjoy it. Funny how things turn out. I thought psychology was my passion, along with writing, and now coding. I think my passion is just to find my creative outlet. To find some type of release to let the bad energy out, and not only help myself, but humanity as a whole. Who knows, maybe one day I'll be a cool hacker stealing money from big bank men and giving it out to the poor. I'm pretty sure I'll write a poem about it one day. </p>

  <ul style="font-family:courier;">
    <li> I don't know what to write </li>
    <li> to think I could actually blog </li>
    <li> I don't even know how to format a blog that'll include poetry... what?? </li>
    <li> It just seems like too much is going on </li>
    <li> maybe they'll teach us how to insert folders or something </li>
    <li> Oh talk about how you lost at nationals, how everyone is a writer deep down, how you progress, no such thing as a bad writer, not everyone will like or understand your creations but thats okay & how it's an outlet </li>

    <h3> Finding your invisible self </h3>
<p id="indent">I know you're probably thinking what do you mean find your invisible self? I'm right here reading this, Duh! We'll when I mean invisble self, I mean your conscience. Listening to yourself, and figuring out who you really are. No matter what religion you follow, I think being spirtually aware, and being good with the universe (and yourself) will help you find your invisible self. For me, I am most in touch with myself when I get to write, or when I'm somewhere super quiet with nice scenery like the woods. (I absolutely LOVE camping.) I believe to find yourself you have to find something you're passionate about. </p>
